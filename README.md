# MEAN-Tip_Project

This Tip app will provide some recommendations of how much to tip for a particular service. 

users will be able to enter in their bill amount and have the option of selecting between three options:
1 - Good Tip (smiley face)
2 - Bad Tip (sad face)
3 - Dont Care (alien face)

Good tips will be a random percentage between 15% - 25%
Bad tips will be a random percentage between 5% - 15%
Dont Care will be a random percentage between 5% - 25%

Users will be able to keep track of their tips history through the account tab.
History of tips may be exported to an excel file(only works for Window right now...)
